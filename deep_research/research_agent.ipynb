      "Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that  reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that  can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted  for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected  from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. \n",

      "Sub-Section: Nature of Products and Services\n",
      "Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made  available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide  customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the  software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is  made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the  updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally  ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with  Software Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and  provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses  are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized  ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises  distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the  software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a  subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a  consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of  such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and  the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud  services are provided. \n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the  action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services  are provided. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot  function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single  performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or  directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. \n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Think Like The Agent\n",
    "What instructions would you give a new work colleague?\n",
    "- **Read the question carefully** - What specific information does the user need?\n",
    "- **Start with broader searches** - Use broad, comprehensive queries first\n",
    "- **After each search, pause and assess** - Do I have enough to answer? What's still missing?\n",
    "- **Execute narrower searches as you gather information** - Fill in the gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Concrete Heuristics (Prevent \"Spin-Out\" on excessive tool calls)\n",
    "Use **Hard Limits** to prevent the research agent from calling tools excessively:\n",
    "- **Stop when you can answer confidently** - Don't keep searching for perfection.\n",
    "- **Give it budgets** - Use 2-3 search tool calls for simple queries. Use up to 5 for complex queries.\n",
    "- **Limit** - Always stop after 5 search tool calls if you cannot find the right source(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Show your thinking\n",
    "After each search tool calling, use [`think_tool` to analyze the results](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool):\n",
    "- What key information did I find? \n",
    "- What's missing?\n",
    "- Do I have enough to answer the question comprehensively?\n",
    "- Should I search more or provide my answer?"
